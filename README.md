# About Me

I'm a 31 year old ICT enthusiast based in Helsinki, Finland. I have lived here most of my life, but I tend to travel quite a bit and by doing that, I could see myself living somewhere else aswell. Before studies, I drove taxi over ten years(and still do occasionally), but felt that I'd wanted to do something bit different so now I'm studying Computer Science in Haaga-Helia Univeristy Of Applied Sciences. My goal is to graduate in 2020 as (frontend/backend/fullstack) developer.

This repositories purpose is to give you a hint of my work and studies. Also this works as a reminder for me for the things I should get done and things that matter to me. If your curious take a look and watch for the changes.

## Programming Languages
* **JavaScript**. This is what I've been working on school, I'm also starting to use it at my own projects as well. Typed variations of JavaScript(TypeScript) for example looks really intresting
* **Python** (and Django). I Started to learn Python as my first programming language and I hope I can pick it up again soon. I have created working web server framework with Django.
* **C#** This one is still on its early starting phase. My first 2D(and 3D after that) is almost ready!
