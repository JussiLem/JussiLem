# 👨‍💻 Biography

Jussi is a 33-year-old dude living in Helsinki, Finland. 
He has lived in Helsinki for most of my life, even though he was born in Stockholm, Sweden. 
Before studies, he drove taxi over ten years, 
but he felt that he wanted to do something different in his life some years ago,
so now he is almost graduated ICT-student in Haaga-Helia Univeristy Of Applied Sciences.

The purpose of these repositories is to give you a hint of Jussi's work and studies. 
Also, this works as a reminder for Jussi about the things he should get done and things that matter to him. 
If your curious take a look and watch for the changes.
