# About Me

I'm a 33-year-old dude living in Helsinki, Finland. 
I have lived here in Helsinki for most of my life, even though I was born in Stockholm, Sweden. 
Before studies, I drove taxi over ten years, 
but I felt that I'd wanted to do study and do something different in my life some years ago, 
so now I'm almost graduated ICT-student in Haaga-Helia Univeristy Of Applied Sciences.

This repositories purpose is to give you a hint of my work and studies. 
Also this works as a reminder for me about the things I should get done and things that matter to me. 
If your curious take a look and watch for the changes.
